# 2018.3_i-3D_Template
interactive 3D template with GEOINT
i-3D_Template
a general purpose viewer for GEOINT data including terrain, dted, dem, lidar, or other elevation information. My preference is to import elevation data and turn into game engine terrain using TerrainImporter (in the asset store), or use WorldComposer http://www.terraincomposer.com/worldcomposer-release-notes/

this viewer shows elevation, coordinates in UTM and lat lon, and also has compass and measurement capabilites. more capabilities to come in 2020. - 01/02/2020 d3d
